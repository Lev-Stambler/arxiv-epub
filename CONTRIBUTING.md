# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in arxiv-to-ereader!

## Project Status

This is a personal project that I maintain for my own use. I'm not actively seeking contributions and prefer to keep the maintenance burden minimal.

## Before Opening an Issue

- Please check existing issues first
- For bugs, include: Python version, OS, and steps to reproduce
- For feature requests, consider if it fits the project's narrow scope (arXiv HTML → e-reader formats)

## Pull Requests

I'm unlikely to accept PRs for:
- New features outside the core scope
- Major refactors or architectural changes
- Dependencies that add maintenance burden

If you've found a bug and have a fix, feel free to open a PR, but please keep it minimal and focused.

## Forking

You're welcome to fork this project and modify it for your own needs. That's the beauty of open source. The MIT license allows you to do pretty much anything with the code.

## Contact

For critical security issues only, open an issue with `[SECURITY]` in the title.

For everything else, I may not respond promptly (or at all). This isn't rudeness—I just have limited time and want to keep this project low-maintenance.
